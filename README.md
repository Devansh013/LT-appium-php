## PHP With Appium 

In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your **PHP** automation testing scripts with **Appium** on **LambdaTest Real Device Cloud platform**.

## Objective

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Run a sample automation script of **PHP** for application testing with **Appium** on **LambdaTest**.
2. Learn more about Desired Capabilities for Appium testing.
3. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin automation testing with Selenium, you would need to follow these steps:

### Clone The Sample Project

**Step-1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s :link: [LT-appium-php](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-php) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-php
cd LT-appium-php
```

### Installing Project Dependencies

<details>

<summary id="summary_2"> <strong>Install PHP (latest)</strong> </summary>

**Step-2:** Download and install the latest version of PHP in your system.

**MacOS:** Previous versions of **MacOS** have **PHP** installed by default. But for the latest **MacOS** versions starting with **Monterey**, **PHP** has to be downloaded and installed manually by using below commands:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install php
```

**Windows:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php
```

:::tip
For **Windows**, you can download **PHP** from [here](http://windows.php.net/download/). Also, refer to this [documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.php) for ensuring the accessibility of PHP through Command Prompt(cmd).
:::

</details>

<details>

<summary id="summary_2"> <strong>Download Composer in the project directory</strong>
</summary>

**Step-3:** Download **composer** in the project directory from here ([Linux/MacOS](https://getcomposer.org/download/), [Windows](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows)).

:::tip note

To use the **composer** command directly, it either should have been downloaded in the project directory or should be accessible globally which can be done by the command below:

```bash
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

:::

Install the composer dependencies in the current project directory using the command below:

```php
composer install
```

</details>

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

**Step-4:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
 
 **For Windows:**
 
  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
  
### Upload Your Application

**Step-5:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
`}

**For Windows:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""`}

**Using App URL:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'`}

**For Windows:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{\"url\":\"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk\",\"name\":\"sample.apk\"}"`}

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first PHP test on LambdaTest.

Test Scenario: Check out [Android.php](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-php/blob/master/AndroidApp.php) file to view the sample test script for android and [iOS.php](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-php/blob/master/IOSApp.php) for iOS.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

**Step-6:** You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```csharp title="iOS(.ipa)"
  $caps = array(
    "app"=>"lt://", // Enter app_url here
    "deviceName"=>"iPhone 11",
    "platformVersion"=>"14",
    "platformName"=>"ios",
    "isRealMobile"=>true,
    "video"=>true,
    "visual"=>true,
    "name"=>"Php - iOS test",
    "build" => "Php Vanilla - iOS"
 );
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android-config" label="Android" default>

```php title="Android(.apk)"
  $caps = array(
        "app"=>"lt://", //Enter app_url here
        "deviceName" => "Galaxy S20",
        "platformName" => "Android",
        "platformVersion" => "10",
        "isRealMobile" => TRUE,
        "visual" => TRUE,
        "video" => TRUE,
        "name" => "Php - Android test",
        "build" => "Php Vanilla - Android"
    );
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/beta/index.html)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).

### Executing The Tests

**Step-7:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

```bash
php IOSApp.php
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

```bash
php AndroidApp.php
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info:** Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
